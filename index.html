     <p>
        As the leading <span>synthetic phonics</span> publisher, and the most experienced, we offer a 7-year programme that teaches not only phonics, but spelling, punctuation and grammar too, enabling children to read and write from an early age.
     </p>
     <p id="secondparagraph">
        The Jolly Phonics Handbook (in print letters) is a complete resource for teaching young children the skills they need to read and write fluently in their first year of school. This book is a comprehensive resource for teachers who want the flexibility of teaching the program with worksheets and other photocopiable resources in the classroom. It offers step-by-step guidance on all aspects of the teaching across the year, as well as a wealth of practical ideas and fun activities for the children.
